# DragToReshape
A CreateJS demo where we drag points to reshape an object.

See it in action here: http://evili.com/HTML5/DragToReshape/

Click one of the buttons on the left to choose a rectangle, rhombus or square. Then drag the shape by one of the green dots.
The shapes can be stretched or spun around. Note how the segment lengths are output beneath.
